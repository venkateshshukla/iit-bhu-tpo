    <h1 align="center">Training &amp; Placement Procedure and Policy</h1>
    <p>      
    <ol>
        <li>The company should fill in the Job Notification Form (JNF) and submit it to the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) either online, as an e-mail attachment to tpo@iitbhu.ac.in, or as a hard copy. The JNF serves as an introduction of the job profile for the benefit of the candidates and also informs them of the company's requirements. </li>
        <li>The JNF is electronically broadcasted to all the students along with all the other relevant information furnished by the company.</li>
        <li>The company can ask for the resumes of interested students and has the liberty to shortlist them before the beginning of the placement process.</li>
        <li>The company will be allotted slots and dates for conducting Pre-Placement Talk (PPT)/Written Test/Online Test, with a request to confirm the same by a specified date. On failing to do so, the allotted slot may be given to other companies on their request. Request for any change in the slot can be entertained subject to its availability.</li>
        <li>The company may also, if interested, conduct selections for summer internship during this period.</li>
        <li>TPC advises the companies to conduct the PPT before the recruitment process for final placement commences. This will provide ample time to the students for making a considered decision in joining the company. Early conduct of Written/Online test may facilitate the company in earning an early slot for final placement.</li>
        <li>In case the company finds it inconvenient to visit the campus twice for going through its complete selection process, it can be accommodated to carry out the entire selection process, including PPT, during final placement season on a mutually agreed date. However, in such a situation it may not be possible to accommodate the company in the early days of the final placement season.</li>
        <li>The final placement process (Group Discussion (GD)/Interview) shall start from December 01, 2014.</li>
        <li>The list of shortlisted students for the final placement process is to be mailed to the TPC by the company prior to December 01, 2014.</li>
        <li>The placement process will be slotted as per the details given below:
            <ol>
                <li>December 01, 2014 - December 04, 2014: Two slots/day
                    <ol>
                        <li>Slot 1 : 08:00 AM - 03:00 PM</li>
                        <li>Slot 2 : 04:00 PM - 11:00 PM</li>
                    </ol>
                </li> 
                <li>December 05, 2014 onwards: One slot/day
                    <ol>
                        <li>Slot 1 : 10:30 AM - 6:30 PM</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>TPC generally allots a date and a slot to the company for the final placement process based on the following criteria:
            <ol>
                <li>Job profile and growth prospects</li>
                <li>Package being offered by the company (CTC and Take-Home)</li>
                <li>Past record of recruitment</li>
                <li>Conduct of Pre Placement Talks/Written Test/Online Test before final placement (as mentioned in point [6] above)</li>
                <li>Feedback from the students/alumni regarding the company</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The company visits the campus on scheduled dates and conducts the Written/Online Test/GD/Interview as part of their selection procedure during the slot assigned to them. It is important to understand that, on the same date, another company may be scheduled before/after yours and any shift is bound to cause inconvenience to yourself and others as well.</li>
        <li>The Institute follows "One Student One Job" policy, other than low paid jobs that are from IT companies who recruit 50 or more students.</li>
        <li>It is possible that a student shortlisted by a company might secure a job prior to the company's scheduled slot for the final placement process. TPC will provide a comprehensive list of such students to the company before its scheduled slot. Because of non-availability of such already selected candidates, the company is advised to maintain an extended list of shortlisted candidates, who can then be made eligible for the final placement process.
        </li>
        <li>The final selection results are to be submitted to the Cell by the end of the assigned slot. The Cell in turn, will inform the related students. Students with multiple offers will be required to finalize their option for one company and inform TPC within half an hour from the end of the slot. His/her choice would be informed to all the concerned companies. In this situation, to ensure that the company does not suffer on the front of recruitment, the company is suggested to prepare a list of students, in order of their merit, who can be kept waitlisted. Any drop out from the main-list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the company will be informed of the same.</li>
        <li>The company is required to send offer letters to TPC, who will then hand it over to the concerned students. Such letters are expected to reach the Cell before the end of March 2015.</li>
        <li>Points (13-16) are also applicable for intern hiring.</li>

<div id="tnp-policy" class="tile-content ui-placements ui-replace" >
   <h1 align="center">Placement Policy for Placement Session 2013-14</h1>
   <p>The role of the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) is of a facilitator and counselor for placement related activities. The placement policy detailed hereunder will be applicable to all the students registered for the 2013-14 campus placement season and shall be followed during the entire season. </p>
   <h2>Guidelines</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Applying for a company or joining a company is entirely the responsibility/decision of the student concerned.</li>
      <li>The placement policy is <b>One Student One Job</b>. However, if the first job is from a Mass Recruiter* Company, the student may go for a non-Mass Recruiter company in addition.</li>
      <li>There is no restriction for a student on applying for a position in any company or appearing in test, interview etc.  until a job is secured by him/her. A student will be considered to have secured a job if his/her name appears in the selection list, an appointment letter is received by the TPC or if a PPO is accepted by him/her.</li>
      <li>The final results of all the companies interviewing in a particular slot are to be submitted to the cell by the end of the slot. In case of a student being selected by more than one company, the student will choose only one of these offers immediately after the slot/day is over and all the results from the companies scheduled in that slot is received by the cell. His/her choice would be informed to all the concerned companies. In this situation, to ensure that the company does not suffer on the front of recruitment, it is suggested to prepare a panel of students in order of their merit who would be kept waitlisted. Any drop out from the main list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the same will be informed to the company.</li>
      <li>The company is required to send offer letters to the Placement Cell, who will then hand it over to the concerned students. Such letters should reach the cell before the end of March, 2014. Students would be available to join the company from 1st week of June, 2014 onwards only after the completion of their course formalities.</li>
   </ol>
   <p><i>*A Mass Recruiter Company is deemed to be a company offering an IT Software Profile with a CTC of less than 4.5 lacs per annum and hiring at least 50 students.</i></p>
   <h2>Pre Placement Offers (PPOs)</h2>
   <ol>
   <li>All PPOs, offered to our students by the company, have to be intimated to the cell.</li>
   <li>The PPO will be counted as a job unless the related student rejects the offer within 2 working days of the notification sent to him/her by the cell.</li>
   <li>Any student, found to have not informed the cell about the secured PPO, will be debarred from the placement process. If in the meantime, the student gets another campus selection, the company in which he/she is placed will be intimated of the violation and the student will not be handed over the offer letter.</li>
   <li>The students will be allowed to apply for other companies until a PPO is extended to them under intimation to the cell.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Penalty Structure</h2>
   <p>Each student will be assigned a total of 10 points at the time of registration with TPC. Points awarded will be deducted for misconduct as per the following rules.</p>
   <ol>
   <li>A student will not be allowed to participate in the selection process of the company for which he/she has missed the PPT. The students are required to take their seats at least 5 minutes before the scheduled beginning time of the PPT. The students who come in time will be given a slip which they are required to return (duly self-signed and filled in) while exiting the venue of PPT. Only such students shall be allowed to participate in further selection process of that company.</li>
   <li>Students are provided an option to withdraw willingness from a company at least 48 hours before the start of first round of the selection procedure. Opting out of the selection process, at any stage after this, may lead to a deduction of 4 points for missing test, 5 for missing GD and 6 for missing interview.</li>
   <li>Any sort of misbehavior on the part of students which affects the decorum of the PPT or the selection process or the reputation of the TPC/institute attracts a penalty of 5 points.</li>
   <li>Losing all the 10 points will lead to deregistration from TPC and the candidate will not be eligible for campus selection further.</li>
   </ol>

   <h1 align="center">Placement Policy for Placement Session 2014-15 (Internal)</h1>
   <p>The role of the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) is of a facilitator and counselor for placement related activities, and it does NOT guarantee a job to a student even on his/her being registered with the cell. The placement policy detailed hereunder will be applicable to all the students registered for the 2014-15 campus placement season and is to be followed during the entire season. </p>
   <h2>Guidelines</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Applying for a company or joining a company is entirely the responsibility/decision of the student concerned.</li>
      <li>The placement policy is <b>One Student One Job</b>.  However, if the first job is from a Mass Recruiter* Company, the student may go for a non-Mass Recruiter company in addition.</li>
      <li>There is no restriction for a student on applying for a position in any company or appearing in test, interview etc. until a job is secured by him/her. A student will be considered to have secured a job if his/her name appears in the selection list, an appointment letter is received by the TPC or if a PPO is accepted by him/her.</li>
      <li>The slot system to be followed is as under:<br/>
	<ul>
	 <li>December 01, 2014 - December 04, 2014: Two slots/day
	  <ol>
	   <li>Slot 1: 08:00 AM - 03:00 PM</li>
	   <li>Slot 2: 04:00 PM - 11:00 PM</li>
	  </ol>
	 </li>
	 <li>December 05, 2014 onwards: One slot/day
	  <ol><li>Slot 1: 10:30 AM - 6:30 PM</li></ol>
	 </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>The final results of all the companies interviewing in a particular slot are to be submitted to the cell by the end of the slot. In case of a student being selected by more than one company, the student has to choose only one of these offers immediately after the
slot/day is over and all the results from the companies scheduled in that slot are received by the cell. His/her choice would be informed to all the concerned companies. In this situation, to ensure that the company does not suffer on the front of recruitment, it will be suggested to the companies to prepare a panel of students in order of their merit who would be kept waitlisted. Any drop out from the main list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the same will be informed to the company.</li>
      <li>Students must keep their Identity Card with them at the time of PPT/Test/Group Discussion/ Interview, and produce the same when demanded by the visiting team of the company or staff or Training and Placement Representatives (TPRs).</li>
	<li>Students are requested to forward contacts they have, if any, in different companies so that the TPC may formally invite these companies for placements.</li>
	<li>The company is required to send offer letters to the Placement Cell, who will then hand it over to the concerned students. Such letters are expected to reach the cell before the end of March, 2015.</li>
	<li>The students facing any kind of problem at any stage of the selection process should bring it to the knowledge of the cell within 24 working hours from the time of incidence in the form of an email.</li>
	<li>ny student participating in the selection process of a company is forbidden from making direct contact with any company personnel under any circumstances. In case of an emergency, the student should contact the TPC or the TPR coordinator appointed for the company with his/her problem who will then put it before the company for consideration.</li>
   </ol>
   <p><i>*A Mass Recruiter Company is deemed to be a company offering an IT Software Profile CTC of less than 4.5 lakhs per annum and hiring at least 50 students.</i></p>
   <h2>Pre Placement Offers (PPOs)</h2>
   <ol>
   <li>PPO offered by the company has to be intimated to the cell.</li>
   <li>The companies which pick up interns from the campus selection shall be asked in advance about any PPOs that have been extended by them. They shall also be asked about the possibility of a PPO being received in the future.</li>
   <li>The students will be allowed to apply for other companies as per the normal policy until a PPO is extended to them.</li>
   <li>The PPO will be counted as a job unless the related student rejects the offer within 2 working days of the notification sent to him/her by the cell in the form of an email. The rejection has to be conveyed to the cell in the form of either an email to willingness.tpo@iitbhu.ac.in or a paper application. In the latter case, the students must keep a copy of the same which should have an inward diary number and the initials of the staff of the cell.</li>
	<li>If the PPO is accepted, the job will be recorded and he/she will NOT be allowed to participate in the campus placements. However, he/she will be allowed to participate in the process if the offer is rejected. The rejection letter will be sent to the company by the
cell.</li>
	<li>Any student, found to have not informed the cell about the secured PPO, will be debarred from the placement process. If in the meantime, the student gets another job from campus selection, the company in which he/she is placed will be intimated of the violation
and the student will not be handed over the offer letter.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Penalty Structure</h2>
   <ol>
   <li>A student will not be allowed to participate in the selection process of the company for which he/she has missed the PPT. The students are required to take their seats at least 15 minutes before the scheduled beginning time of the PPT. Gate attendance with willing
list and ID card matching will be done by the assigned coordinators.</li>
   <li>The students who wish to withdraw from the proceedings must bring it to the knowledge of the cell according to the following criteria:
      <ul>
        <li>Companies visiting twice to the campus (1st time for written examination & PPT; 2nd time for the interview and selection process): 48 hours before the company is scheduled. 
	</li>
        <li>Companies visiting once to the campus (for the whole selection process): 48 hours before the PPT/Written Test/Online Test. 
	</li>
      </ul>
      Students violating the above norms will be debarred from the placement process.
   </li>
   <li>Cheating in any form or marking proxies during the selection process is strictly prohibited and those caught indulging in such activities will be summarily debarred from the placement process. Also note that no concessions in any form shall be provided in such
cases.</li>
   <li>If the Training & Placement representatives are found incapable in doing their job then it will be duly informed by the Core Committee to the Professor Incharge, TPC and the punishment includes debarment from the placement session/replacement as TPR. The TPR will be judged on the basis of his/her commitment towards his duties such as number of companies coordinated, meetings attended, branch reviews, etc.</li>
   </ol>
Any sort of misbehaviour/misconduct on the part of students, which affects the decorum of the PPT or the selection process or the reputation of the TPC/Institute, including asking inappropriate/embarrassing questions, coming in slippers and not possessing the ID card, will result in the student being debarred from sitting further in the selection process of the company.
